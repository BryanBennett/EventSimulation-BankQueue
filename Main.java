Decription: This main class creates an array of tellers and a queue of customers. It dynamically assigns customers to tellers
when a teller becomes available, and creates customers based off of the probability provided by the user as a command line argument.
This class tracks the current time in minutes and runs these commands until the clock reaches MAXCLOCK.

Note: Command line arguments must be provided to this program. The first argument is a probability bw 0 and 1,
the second is the number of tellers and the third is the maximum amount of time any customer may require for service.
Send these arguments, separated by spaces, to the main (String[] args)
